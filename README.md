# CSOPESY Process Scheduler and CLI
This project features a Process Scheduler with a Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling users to explore and manage various CPU scheduling algorithms. Designed to mimic the process scheduling within an operating system, the emulator provides a hands-on experience with core scheduling concepts, allowing users to perform system-level operations and interact with the scheduler through a simple CLI.
